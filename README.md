# Image-Captioning

1.  Implemented a project pipeline that leverages deep learning to generate natural language descriptions of images with a focus on predicting the activities depicted.
2.  The system utilized a CNN backbone to identify image features and an LSTM language model to learn relevant context from the input sequence from the CNN network. 
3.  Trained the model using the Flickr 8k dataset and achieved an average BLEU score of 0.4.
